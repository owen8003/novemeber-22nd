    <p> November 22nd is the second day you were in the hospital. November 21st is when I came back from chicago that morning and you were at camp kern for so long so we didnâ€™t see each other for a long time. On the drive home I kept sleeping so time would go by faster so I could see you. Often before I see you I do something so seeing you appears to be faster like I go frisbee golfing with my dad so it seems that I see you way faster haha that might not make sense. Anyway we went to chick fila to get the peppermint shake that night and later that night you felt really dizzy and of course i was really worried and didn't know what to do. You started barking and talking about how goobers are bad and frosty with fries are so good and that's when i knew something was wrong (Kidding) anyway at the hospital I stayed with you and your mom it was really fun ahha. Not like you being in the hospital was fun but like talking to you and your mom was(had to clarify) The next day you went to the hospital and I couldn't stay overnight. I'm sorry. And you've been doing amazing and will continue being amazing in all aspects! You are so strong and brave im so proud of you!
